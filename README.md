# Personal Blog

Simple blog application made with AdonisJS for the Backend and VueJS for the Frontend. The frontend consists of two areas the manager area where the blog's admin can create pages, manage users read contact messages and perhaps much more. And the site area where it contains the landing page, posts page, post page, about page the contact page, etc. The project is Open Source and I planned to use it to build a personal blog for myself.
